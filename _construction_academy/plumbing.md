Plumbers and pipe fitters install and repair pipe systems that carry water, steam, air, and other fluids or gases. The goal of this program is to train students and provide them with the entry level skills needed to enter the plumbing and pipe fitting industry. Freshman and sophomores are trained in the shop environment. Juniors and seniors do more actual hands-on work in the field, as well as in the shop.
